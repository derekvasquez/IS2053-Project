Python IS2053 Project
# 🚀 Space Launch Data Analysis

This project analyzes over 4,000 space missions to find trends in launches, success rates, and rocket costs.

## 👥 Team Members
- Derek Vasquez  
- Christopher Jaimes Gonzalez

## 📁 Files
- `Project.ipynb` – Code and graphs for the project  
- `Space Corrected.csv` – Cleaned version of the dataset  
- `requirements.txt` – List of Python packages used  
- `README.md` – Project summary  

## 🔍 What We Asked
1. Who launched the most rockets?
2. How has launch activity changed over time?
3. Which companies are the most successful?
4. What countries launch the most?
5. Does rocket cost affect mission success?

## 📊 What We Found
- **RVSN USSR** has launched the most rockets historically.
- **Launches peaked** during the 1960s–70s and are rising again after 2010.
- **Most top companies** have high success rates (~90%+).
- **Russia and the USA** dominate global launches.
- **Successful missions** tend to use higher-cost rockets, but cost doesn’t guarantee success.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib

## 📌 Summary
We used pandas and matplotlib to analyze Space Launch data. We explored global space launches to answer real-world questions about space activity and mission success.
